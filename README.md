Xournal Note Manager - Simple OneNote-like note management for Xournal

This program provides a basic user interface for creating and opening notebooks and notes for Xournal. It depends on Xournal, NW.js, and jQuery (installed to "/usr/share/javascript/jquery/jquery.min.js" - this is the default for the "jquery" package in the Arch User Repository and on many other Linux platforms).
